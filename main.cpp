// With regular computing, you represent numbers with transistors (I think)
// You have logic gates and then you have off/on, 0 or 1, true or false
// And then we build all subsequent logic for programming based on that
// I.e. combine 0 and 1 to for machine code and represent more complex numbers

// But with qunatum gates, you no longer have binary
    // You have qubits. Those have quaternion gates ( I think ) which can be anything at once
    // So you need phyiscists to create quantum gates and quantum computing is extremely difficult
